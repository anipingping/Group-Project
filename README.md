# Self Assessment
## My role in the Weather Data Analysis Group Project
My teammates Alice, Laurina, Lili and Della were kind enough to admit me as a fifth member of their group after no classmates expressed an interest in my Strava API group project idea. Adding a fifth member to a group project that had a grading rubric that assumed there would be only 3 or 4 members definitely created confusion early on because it was not clear which role (circle, square, triangle or X) I would take on, or whether roles would be shared. I can't say that every group member was immediately on board with me joining but we made it work in the end and I owe my team a big thank you for allowing me to participate. I really don't know what I would have done if this hadn't worked out.

Initially, my role was kind of a database administrator role as our group attempted to utilize the site pythonanywhere.com to host our flask-based data files and dashboard features. When it became apparent that none of us really knew how to use pythonanyhwere (including the TAs who seemed more familiar with Heroku), my role shifted from database administrator to dashboard/visualization specialist.

I became the dashboard/visualization specialist. However, dashboard generation and visualization were not my strong suits in this course. Consequently, I had to overcome a number of technical challenges as I developed my javascript, index.html and style.css files. I enjoyed my work creating our team's dashboard but it was not easy. I booked a tutoring session which ultimately was not helpful because the tutor was herself not very comfortable with javascript. It turns out that using javascript and html to launch websites and create graphics is actually quite a delicate little dance! Even experienced programmers and developers can get bogged down resolving little errors. 

Gradually, through a slow and arduous process of basic trial-and-error and with help from our TAs, I got our dashboard to successfully read .csv and .json files from our data wranglers, made little adjustments to elements like pie chart and donut chart color schemes, x-axis titles, y-axis titles, our weather panel summary numerical configuration. By the time our group presented on Monday evening, our dashboard functioned perfectly and presented the viewer with a good understanding of the weather patterns for a given city.

I also contributed a lot of intrinsic passion and motivation for this project. I like weather! I wrote our group's motivation/questions to answer section of our read.me file and posed the key questions that our project would try to answer. 

Additionally, I was the meeting administrator/scheduler. The group used my Zoom account to schedule and hold almost every meeting. Even when I could not attend, I still made sure to launch the Zoom meeting and assign a host so the group could conduct work. 

## My Greatest Personal Challenge over the Course of the Project: Lack of Time
As I overcame various technical challenges loading data or getting visuals to launch properly, I also had to struggle with other high-priority demands on my time: 
- I work full time for a city government; 
- I have 2 children aged 1 year and 2.5 years; 
- I  play in two local orchestras and both had concerts scheduled during this course's group project phase; 
- my wife and I sold our house and bought a new house in the same window. 

Each one of these other commitments taken alone would be super important and demand all my attention but managing all four of them together AND completing our group project really was all I could handle. I think our dashboard functions really well and looks great. It presents data clearly and in an interesting way for the viewer. Still, with more time and fewer other commitments, I could have done an even better job. I could have made our dashboard look REALLY slick if I had had more time. I suppose the "if only I had more time" complaint is not new. We do the best we can with what we have, don't we?


# Team Assessment
## Alice Medvedev
Alice had the initial idea for this project and had a clear vision of what she wanted to accomplish. Alice is a very gifted coder who understands programming languages and syntax in a way that I haven't seen from most other people in our class. She is very intelligent and I have a lot of respect and admiration for the way her mind works and for her ambition to create a nuanced, sophisticated weather project. Additionally, Alice was the one who initially agreed to include me in this group. She understood my needs and seemed to appreciate my sincere interest in weather and in helping the group. 

If I had one critique of Alice it would be for her to more fully appreciate the limitations of her colleagues and to try to help them a little more. As I leave this class and think about Alice and our group project I can't help but feel that I came up short and that I failed to meet her expectations. I would definitely work with her again. Whether she would want to work with me is another question!

## Laurina LaStella
Laurina designated herself as the "task master" and I am grateful to her for that. Laurina kept people focused, kept notes on meetings, posted reminders and lists of tasks to our group Slack channel. Additionally, Laurina contributed important data wrangling work with Alice and helped to provide the data visualization specialists (me and Lili) with data files. Laurina is a seasoned professional who "gets it" when it comes to staying organized, working hard, and understanding what is needed to complete a project. 

One critique I might have of Laurina might be to be even MORE MEAN when it comes to reminding people of the importance of attending meetings, completing work on time, and driving the group forward. I liked her leadership style and I wanted even more of it on occasion. I would definitely work with Laurina again and I thank her for her efforts. She was our chief operating officer.

## Della Wong
Della seemed very busy with her other commitments over the course of this project. I am not aware of any technical data wrangling, database management, or visualization/dashboard work that she contributed, but I know Della created the slides and basic layout for our group presentation. Della was often late to meetings and would ask the group to bring her up to speed on what the group had discussed while she was away. She would become sidetracked by logistical questions about grading or due dates that (in my personal opinion) were not important. These things used up too much of our limited time. I am not sure that I would want to work with Della on another project because I simply did not get a clear picture of her capabilities as a data scientist and I was frequently frustrated by her attendance record and her contributions to meetings.

I am grateful to Della, however, because she forced me to develop more patience and understanding. I also missed several meetings because of conflicts. There were times when I did not understand what the group was discussing and would need to take the group's time to be brought up to speed. She helped me recognize my own limitations and thereby to have more patience with her and also with myself. 

## Lili Han
Lili was my data visualization and dashboard colleague. I worked most closely with Lili to create the interactive dashboard that we presented in class. Lili helped me resolve almost every technical challenge that she and I encountered. Lili worked late hours. Lili would meet with me outside of the larger group meetings to conduct actual work. Lili shared her phone number with me and we kept in regularly phone/text communication throughout the project. Lili had the ability to challenge Alice on a number of important technical obstacles that the group was encountering and to remind Alice that her original vision was probably not going to be feasible and that adjustments would have to be made. Lili was the all-star of our group. Lili had the technical ability and the basic sense of teamwork to create a successful project. She is also a very sweet, patient and gentle person and helped me in a number of ways. I would LOVE to work with Lili again and I hope to stay in touch with her in the future. She was a delight.

Taken as a whole and based on what I have seen from the other groups who presented Monday night, I think our group did an outstanding job. We chose an interesting but technically complex project and resolved as many obstacles and challenges as we could with the time that we had and ultimately presented a clean, clear, functioning project on time. I am proud of my group.

# Summary of Project
The purpose of our group's project was to analyze past weather data at a given location to predict/describe the weather at that location. We called an API from https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api to retrieve 20 years of weather data. We created an interactive dashboard that presented the historic weather in a way that a front-end user could quickly consume. We also created a user-inputted query feature that would utilize machine learning to predict/categorize the weather and return that information back to the user.
