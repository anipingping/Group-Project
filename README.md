# Self Assessment
## My role in the Weather Data Analysis Group Project
My teammates Alice, Laurina, Lili and Della were kind enough to admit me as a fifth member of their group after no classmates expressed an interest in my Strava API group project idea. Adding a fifth member to a group project that had a grading rubric that assumed there would be only 3 or 4 members definitely created confusion early on because it was not clear which role (circle, square, triangle or X) I would take on, or whether roles would be shared. I can't say that every group member was immediately on board with me joining but we made it work in the end and I owe my team a big thank you for allowing me to participate. I really don't know what I would have done if this hadn't worked out.

Initially, my role was kind of a database administrator role. I created an account at the website pythonanywhere.com and attempted to create a functioning web page on that site. However, as our group attempted to utilize the pythonanywhere.com to host our flask-based data files and dashboard features, it became apparent that none of us really knew how to use it (including the TAs who alle seemed more familiar with Heroku). I abandoned pythonanyhwere due to a lack of familiarity and comfort with the site and my role shifted from database administrator to dashboard/visualization specialist.

I became the dashboard/visualization specialist. I had to overcome a number of technical challenges as I developed my javascript, index.html and style.css files. I enjoyed my work creating our team's dashboard but it was not easy. I booked a tutoring session which ultimately was not helpful because the tutor was herself not very comfortable with javascript. It turns out that using javascript and html to launch websites and create graphics is actually quite a delicate little dance! Even experienced programmers and developers can get bogged down resolving little errors. 

Gradually, through a slow and arduous process of basic trial-and-error and with help from our TAs, I got our dashboard to successfully read .csv and .json files from our data wranglers, made little adjustments to elements like pie chart and donut chart color schemes, x-axis titles, y-axis titles, our weather panel summary numerical configuration. By the time our group presented on Monday evening, our dashboard functioned perfectly and presented the viewer with a good understanding of the weather patterns for a given city.

I also contributed a lot of intrinsic passion and motivation for this project. I like weather! I wrote our group's motivation/questions to answer section of our read.me file.

Additionally, I was the meeting administrator/scheduler. The group used my Zoom account to schedule and hold almost every meeting. Even when I could not attend, I still made sure to launch the Zoom meeting and assign a host so the group could conduct work. 

Last, I conducted a lot of research during the design phase. I shared links to the National Weather Service and the United States Geological Survey's glossary of weather terms and conditions. I would have loved to do more research along these lines if we had had more time.

## My Greatest Personal Challenge over the Course of the Project: Lack of Time
As I overcame various technical challenges loading data or getting visuals to launch properly, I also had to struggle with other high-priority demands on my time: 
- I work full time for a city government; 
- I have 2 children aged 1 year and 2.5 years; 
- I  play in two local orchestras and both had concerts scheduled during this course's group project phase; 
- my wife and I sold our house and bought a new house in the same window. 

Each one of these other commitments taken alone would be super important and demand all my attention but managing all four of them together AND completing our group project really was all I could handle. I think our dashboard functions really well and looks great. It presents data clearly and in an interesting way for the viewer. Still, with more time and fewer other commitments, I could have done an even better job. I could have made our dashboard look REALLY slick if I had had more time. I suppose the "if only I had more time" complaint is not new. We do the best we can with what we have, don't we?

# Team Assessment

## Communication Protocol
Our group extensively used Slack. I maintained individual message threads with almost every group member and we maintained a detailed group channel. Additionally, the group used my Zoom account to hold in-person meetings and work sessions where we could share screens, review and resolve technical challenges, and discuss improvements to our dashboard. We tried to meet at least twice a week outside of class sessions. Some of us met separately more than twice a week to work on more specific tasks related to our assigned roles. It was sometimes difficult to align everyone's schedules but I am honestly not sure how that could possibly be resolved. We all have our own lives and commitments outside of this class.

## Strenths as a Team
I think every member of our group was highly motivated and sincerely wanted to do well on this project. We opted to present early in order to get bonus points. We met frequently and gave a lot of our evenings to this project. We each gave a sincere, honest effort despite whatever limitations we each may have had. I don't know how future cohorts will choose their groups but it is really important to have motivated people. 

Additionally, we had some very talented individuals in our group. Alice Medvedev is a very gifted computer scientist. Laurina LaStella is a seasoned professional with good communication and organizational skills. Lili Han and I developed a delightful collaboration on our group's dashboard. 

## Tips & Tricks
Use Zoom or a meeting platform that allows members to share screens. This is critical. Use Git or Slack to share code files. Use Slack to post helpful links and research. Get every group member's phone number. Create an effective, shared Google Drive calendar that shows each group member's availability. Don't be afraid to speak up for yourself and let others know if/when you get stuck on something. Book tutoring sessions. Message the TAs. Pull every lever you can think of.

## Honorable Mention: My Colleague Lili Han
Lili was my data visualization and dashboard colleague. I worked most closely with Lili to create the interactive dashboard that we presented in class. Lili helped me resolve almost every technical challenge that she and I encountered. Lili worked late hours. Lili would meet with me outside of the larger group meetings to conduct  work on our dashboard. Lili scheduled tutoring sessions, like me, to help our group move the project forward. Lili shared her phone number with me and we kept in regularly phone/text communication throughout the project. Lili had the ability to challenge Alice on a number of important technical obstacles that the group was encountering and to remind Alice that her original vision was probably not going to be feasible and that adjustments would have to be made. Lili was able to speak to our needs for data in a certain format in a way that was understandable and accurate. Lili was the all-star of our group. Lili had the technical ability and the basic sense of teamwork to create a successful project. She is also a very sweet, patient and gentle person and helped me in a number of ways. I would LOVE to work with Lili again and I hope to stay in touch with her in the future. She was a delight.

Taken as a whole and based on what I have seen from the other groups who presented Monday night, I think our group did an outstanding job. We chose an interesting but technically complex project and resolved as many obstacles and challenges as we could with the time that we had and ultimately presented a clean, clear, functioning project on time. I am proud of my group.

# Summary of Project
## Topic Addressed
The purpose of our group's project was to analyze past weather data at a given location to predict/describe the weather at that location. We called an API from https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api to retrieve 20 years of weather data. We created an interactive dashboard that presented the historic weather in a way that a front-end user could quickly consume. We also created a user-inputted query feature that would utilize machine learning to predict/categorize the weather and return that information back to the user. 

## Machine Module Used
Our group used unsupervised machine learning to cluster weather conditions by category and return to a front-end user a prediction or categorization of the weather they would be likely to encounter at a given location for a given time range.

## Results of the Analysis
